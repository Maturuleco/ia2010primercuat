    text: "I live near this place and come fairly often because it's handy. The food is average snack food and the coffee is terrible (clearly no-one has been shown how to make a decent coffee). On the positive side the cakes are usually pretty tasty (try the ricotta cheesecake-delicious) and the ice-cream is fantastic. But the real downer with this place is the service; it is ALWAYS slow, you have to wait ages for everything: a menu; to come take your order; for a coffee; for your bill; for your change. Everything involves a long wait! And don't expect friendliness and a smile, they're not here."
